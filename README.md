<B>PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS WITH PYTHON</B>

This workshop explores Python programming language as a tool in the 
scientific environments and how the language, with several available 
open source libraries can serve as a powerful weapon in your data 
analysis arsenal!
In concordance with our previous workshop in Python ([https://github.com/arjangvt/PythonWorkshop](https://github.com/arjangvt/PythonWorkshop))
the material of this workshop is designed as a stand-alone introduction to the data science 
aspect of Python with a brief emphasize on the basic programming topic.

By the end of the workshop, you should be able to:
<ul>
  <li>Use <b>NumPy</b> for scientific computing</li>
  <li>Use <b>pandas</b> to perform simple data analysis</li>
  <li>Use <b>Sci-kit</b> to generate a simple statistical model of the data</li>
</ul>
